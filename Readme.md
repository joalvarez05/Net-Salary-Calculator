First of all, we have to import Tkinter to use a graphical interface. Then, we have a function named calcular_sueldo_neto because the purpose of this function is to calculate the net salary through the gross salary.

The function calculates the net salary using a try block, performing calculations based on the entered gross salary, retirement contributions, and health insurance, and then it will return the result of the net salary after applying the deductions.

Next, we have an except block to handle any errors (in this case, ValueError), such as entering a letter instead of a number, and it will display a message informing the user that they must enter a numeric value.

After the code, we will define the features we want our Tkinter graphical window to have. I am not an expert in the Tkinter library, but there are several simple things that can be done to modify the aesthetics.

Also the calculator could be modified so that the values to be deducted from the gross salary, such as health insurance, can be entered by the user, allowing the calculator to be used in different situations.
